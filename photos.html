								<h4>Champions 2016/17 Season - Chelsea</h4>
								<p>
									The 2016–17 season was Chelsea's 103rd competitive season, 28th consecutive season in the top flight of English football, 25th consecutive season in the Premier League, and 111th year in existence as a football club.
								</p>
								<p>
									Chelsea won their fifth Premier League title with a 1–0 win away to West Bromwich Albion on 12 May. This season was the last for John Terry, who announced he will leave when his contract ends at the end of the season after Chelsea's final game.
								</p>
								<p>
									The season saw Chelsea equal the Premier League records for consecutive wins in a season (13), fewest draws in a season (3), fewest home draws in a season (0), and home and away wins against different sides (12). They also managed to break the record for number of wins in a season (30), as well as record the second-highest points tally in Premier League history (93).

								<h4>Champions 2017/18 Season - Manchester City</h4>
								<p>
									The 2017–18 season was Manchester City's 116th season of competitive football, 89th season in the top division of English football and 21st season in the Premier League since the league was first created.
								</p>
								<p>
									City won their third Premier League title on 15 April 2018 following West Bromwich Albion's 1–0 win away to second place Manchester United.
								</p>
								<p>
									The team set a number of Premier League records during the season, including: most points (100), most away points (50), most points ahead of second (19), most wins (32), most away wins (16), most goals (106), best goal difference (+79) and most consecutive victories (18). The team also equalled the record for the earliest Premier League title win (5 games to spare), beating every other team in the league throughout the season, and recording the most consecutive away wins (11).[2] As a result of City setting an English top flight record for most points in a single season (100), the team received the nickname "The Centurions", and have been acclaimed by pundits and football journalists as being one of the greatest teams in Premier League history.

								<h4>Champions 2018/19 Season - Manchester City</h4>
								<p>
									The 2018–19 season was Manchester City's 117th season of competitive football, 90th season in the top division of English football and 22nd season in the Premier League since it was first created.
								</p>
								<p>
									During this season, City completed a domestic treble. Apart from winning all three of the major English football tournaments, they also won the Community Shield, the first time any team has ever held all four of England's primary football trophies.

								<h4>Champions 2019/20 Season - Liverpool</h4>
								<p>
									The last time Liverpool were champions of England, the latter was called the Kemlyn. The last time Liverpool were champions of England, James Milner was four years old; here he is now, 34, storming towards the football, shifting his glance backwards, knowing the longer he remains there, the closer confirmation becomes.
								</p>
								<p>
									As Milner's pass finds the legs of a Crystal Palace player, and the ball thuds against the advertising boards, a visceral roar from all four sides of the stadium. It is stoppage time, Liverpool are a goal ahead and running down time; this feels ever-so-familiar, but this feeling is ever so new and novel, so welcome.
								</p>
								<p>
									A lot could have happened in that time - Manchester City would have needed to win two games, Liverpool likewise - but Saturday, March 21 was largely expected to be the day Liverpool were named champions of England.
								</p>
								<p>
									Mathew Street, a strip of fun and fervour and would have been amplified times a thousand, silenced. Perhaps the strangest is not knowing what happens when the time comes to celebrate. Because Liverpool will celebrate, but it might be within the confines of personal abodes. Milner has seemingly spent most of his season in that corner, shielding the ball, as Liverpool held on to a slender advantage at Anfield.
								</p>
								<p>
									There was Fabinho against Manchester City, just a week later, and the realisation this Liverpool team were a cut above. Firmino at Palace, hanging on against Brighton, annihilating Everton; destroying Leicester, grinding out against Spurs, and then Salah in the final minute against Manchester United. Firmino at Molineux, battering Southampton, Mane at Carrow Road, the comeback against West Ham and the tight squeeze against Bournemouth.
								</p>
								<p>
									All of these moments, all of these memories, are of Liverpool winning the league.
								</p>
								<p>
									From United onwards, it has merely been a procession, every game treated as if Liverpool were already champions, and this was their victory parade in front of 54,000 people. Saturday night should have been the night Liverpool confirmed themselves as champions. The moment, the snapshot, the Instagram photograph is still to take place, and the uncertainty of when it will is tough; but look through your camera roll, think back to what has been, and realise Liverpool have been winning the title every week.
