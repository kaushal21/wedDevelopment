						<h4>Reflection About My Site</h4>
					</div>
					<!-- Experience -->
					<p>
						Football is my passion and having to follow football is always a fun time for me. From this project, I was able to learn web designing and website building by practicing on real-life projects that on something that I love. The Mypassionsoccer website was really a fun experience, I had a lot of fun while developing this website. I believe in learning by actually performing the tasks to have a view on what's happening that leads towards better understanding. And by the help of these assignments, I was able to do exactly this i.e. learn by performing. It has taught me a whole new set of ways in which we can make the website building process smoother and more efficient.
					</p>
					<!-- What I planned to do -->
					<p>
						Initially, what I had in my mind was to develop a platform where anyone can follow the premier league. As the idea was pretty straightforward, I thought the implementation would also be as easy. Maintaining the league table, keeping track of the upcoming matches and the previous matches, having the merchandise details for the teams and others. They all seem pretty straightforward to implement but they all have some twists and turns while implementing. Initially, I thought I can put every in HTML files that can serve the purpose. But later realized, there is much more to a website than that.
					</p>
					<!-- What I actually did and how -->
					<p>
						For different sections of this website, I tried to do different things in different ways that could help me have exposure to how to solve a problem in different ways. For the league table, in the first assignment, I have hardcoded every entry in the HTML file, then realizing that since the table is dynamic, it would be changing every time and hardcoding is not the solution. Thus I used JavaScript to store the table data as an array, and then from that array, I can display the table using its data. In the array Itself, some of the entries were dependent on some other entries, for example, goal difference is dependent on goals scored and goals conceived also the points are dependent on the results of the matches. I used functions to calculate these values for the table. By doing this, the effort in producing the table and maintaining the table has reduced a ton. And if we link this to a database, then we don't need the array to store the values either, we can access them from the databases, which would make our tasks a lot easier. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I faced a similar problem for the source log, where there were more than 50 entries which I initially did manually. This is a tedious task as it is a repetitive process and can be automated. Here as well, I understand the value of using dynamic programming and not hard coding.   
					</p>
					<p>
						I planned my site to be platform-independent i.e. it can be viewed from any device with variable width. This is where I faced one of the toughest challenges. While performing the task for Image Map, the image coordinates were strictly for the original image size. I used javascript to dynamically update the coordinates for the Image map, making the shop section the most advanced sections of the website.
					</p>
					<!-- Thank You -->
					<p>
						I have learned a lot about website designing from this assignment. And I want to apply this knowledge that I have learned here to real-life projects. From small things like how important the sitemap and the source log are and how to maintain them, to some big tasks like using javascript to make the web page dynamic in nature. I want to thank all the tutors who were constantly present on Piazza for help, to the Professor, who taught in a smooth manner making the concepts seem very easy and also for designing the assignments in such a way that they gave us hands-on experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Thank you all</b> for the support and knowledge. Hoping to design some cool websites in the future.
